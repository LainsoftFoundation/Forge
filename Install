version 0.3 alfa
2005-mar-03

Preview
-----------------
In order to been able to complie and generate the bin jar
you need to create a "lib" named directory in the project base path
there you will provide this libs:


commons-beanutils  ver >= 1.7
commons-betwixt    ver >= 0.6
commons-collection ver >= 3.1
commons-digister   ver >= 1.6
commons-logging    ver >= 1.0.4
xdoclet            ver >= 1.2.2
servlet-api        ver >= 2.4
jsp-api            ver >= 2.0


Compiling
-----------------

To compile, generate documentation, and the bin jar you will need
apache-ant (soon apache-maven), which you can obtain from http://ant.apache.org/, 
then in the base path of the project just type:

$ ant

In the case you just want to compile the source files just type:

$ ant compile

Generating javadoc:

$ ant docs

Generate web.xml and forge.tld

$ ant webdesc

Create bin jar:

$ ant bin_dist

And finally generate source tar.bzip2 

$ ant src_dist


ToDo
---------------
There are many things to do, so we enlist it:

- Document the project, this means javadoc mostly, 
  and content for the project page

- Mavenize the project

- For the next release we need to aggregate the CompositeCommand
  feature for more details send a mail to hesenrre at gmail dot com 
  (this is a temporal mail address until we fix our mail server)

- Code the persistance, and interaction modules, for more details
  send a mail to the address above.
